## 🔥 What Is a Terraria Cheat?

A **Terraria cheat** is a custom tool, trainer, or mod menu that gives you godlike control over your character and world. You can **spawn anything**, **fly through terrain**, **instantly max gear**, and **toggle game rules** like health, mana, gravity, and mobs.

Use it for creative building, PvP trolling, speedruns, or just full-on sandbox madness.
